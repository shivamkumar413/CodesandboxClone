# Codesandbox Clone
A browser based text editor built using react and Node.js

## Overview
This is a browser based text editor for creating react projects on the browser and running it without changing the tab.

## Tech Stack
1. React js
2. Node js
3. Docker
4. socket.io

1. cd codesandboxClone/frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. cd codesandboxClone/backend
5. npm install
